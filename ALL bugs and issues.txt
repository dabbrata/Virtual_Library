Bugs.....

1.if we want to take the book name by $_REQUEST global varibale
  like "tom&jerry";
  then the normal variable only store first part of name(tom) 
  before & operator
	
  EXAMPLE:
  home_page.php?name="tom&jerry";
  $Name = $_REQUEST['name'];
  echo $Name;
  
  OUTPUT: tom                  //to be output tom&jerry


2.reminder: the session is time out after specific time , which is applied in "header.php,   header2.php,   profile_page.php" i.e for only for users only;
